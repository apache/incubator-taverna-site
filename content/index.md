## Disclaimer

Apache Taverna is an effort undergoing incubation at
[The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](http://apache.org/)
sponsored by the [Apache Incubator PMC](http://incubator.apache.org/).
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
While [incubation status](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/taverna.html)
is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.
