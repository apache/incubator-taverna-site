To receive messages from a list, and to be able to post to it, you need to be *subscribed*:

 - Send an empty message to the **Subscribe** address from above (any message text will be ignored)
 - Wait for the **response** email with a subject like *Confirm subscribe to users@taverna*
 - To **confirm subscription**, reply with an empty message
 - You should now be subscribed to the list

Unsubscribing is done in the same way, using the *Unsubscribe* address instead.

See the [mailing list](/community/lists) page for more details.

### Web chat

Some of the Apache Taverna users and developers occasionally hang out on the
[Gitter chat apache/taverna](/community/chat).

### Report or track a bug

Use the Apache Taverna JIRA [issue tracker](/community/issue-tracker) to report or track a bug.


## Citing Taverna

If you use Taverna in your academic work, you can [cite](/community/cite) one of the
[publications about Taverna](/community/publications).
We also track papers that
[reference Taverna](/community/references), so feel free to
[raise an issue](issue-tracker) or

   We welcome any contributions for the [source code](/download/code/) of Apache Taverna. See how to [contribute code](/download/code/#contribute-to-apache-taverna).


 - **Plugin**

    The mechanism for writing **Apache Taverna 3 plugins** is still under development.
    
    Please contact the [dev@taverna](/community/lists#devtaverna) mailing list for details.

    For **Taverna 2** (non-Apache), see the [Creating plugins for Taverna 2](http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/wiki/display/developer/Creating+plugins+for+Taverna+2) tutorial.

     We recommend that your services are registered in Registries such as:
     [BioCatalogue](http://www.biocatalogue.org)
     
 - **Edit the website**

    This website is always under development. Please help make it better by [editing](/community/edit) or adding pages.


## Incubator status

* [Taverna incubator status](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/taverna.html).
* [Graduation Maturity Assessment](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TAVERNADEV/2016-03+Taverna+Graduation+Maturity+Assessment)

Apache Taverna is an effort undergoing incubation at
[The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](http://apache.org/)
sponsored by the [Apache Incubator PMC](http://incubator.apache.org/).
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
While [incubation status](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/taverna.html)
is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.
