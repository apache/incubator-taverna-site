## How to Use Taverna's Apache JIRA Issue Tracker

<div id="content"><div class="alert alert-info alert-dismissible" role="alert"><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span>
All participants are expected to follow ASF's
<a class="alert-link" href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
</div></div>

Anyone can add an issue by
[creating an account](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa) on Apache's
JIRA issue tracker. An account is also required to
*comment on*, *vote on*, or *watch* issues.
(If you only want to *search for* issues, you do not need an account.)

Once you are on the
[issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA)
site, you have several options for viewing issues.

* [Summary](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel)
  includes a graph and stream of recent activity.
* [Issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:issues-panel)
  provides statistics and a list of unresolved issues by component.
* [Components](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:components-panel)
  allows you to quickly see unresolved and recently updated issues for a given component.




## Adding an issue

After logging in to [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA),
use the [Create](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?pid=12318322)
button at the top of the screen to add a new issue.

* Make sure **Apache Taverna** is selected as the _Project_.
* Give a brief title in _Summary_.
* Describe your issue under _Description_.
* Click **Create**.
* Now you may attach any log files, screenshots or workflows under
  _More_ --> **Attach files**.

Jira will email the
[dev@taverna list](/community/lists#dev)
using the issue key in the
Subject, (e.g. `TAVERNA-987`); you may join the
discussion there or correspond using Jira comments.

## Report a security issue

If you want to report a security concern
(e.g. a buffer exploit), then you should instead
email our [private list](/community/lists#private-mailing-list)
where the Apache Taverna PPMC members 
will consider the issue in confidence.

## Example bug report

<img src="/img/jira-example.png" width="792" height="859"
     style="border: grey dashed 2px; max-width: 100%" />

A great bug report includes:

* Which program did you use? Which version?
* What operating system, which Java version?
* What did you try?
* What went wrong?
* What was expected?
* Error messages
* Logs and stack traces
* Attached workflow (if you are OK to share it publicly)
