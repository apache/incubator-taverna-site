## How to Use Taverna's Apache JIRA Issue Tracker

Anyone can add an issue by
[creating an account](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa) on Apache's
JIRA issue tracker. An account is also required to
*comment on*, *vote on*, or *watch* issues.
(If you only want to *search for* issues, you do not need an account.)

Once you are on the
[issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA)
site, you have several options for viewing issues.

* [Summary](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel)
  includes a graph and stream of recent activity.
* [Issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:issues-panel)
  provides statistics and a list of unresolved issues by component.
* [Components](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:components-panel)
  allows you to quickly see unresolved and recently updated issues for a given component.

## Report a security issue

email our [private list](/community/lists#private-mailing-list)
