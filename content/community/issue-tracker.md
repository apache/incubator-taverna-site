## How to Use Taverna's Apache JIRA Issue Tracker

Anyone can add an issue by [creating an account](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa) on Apache's JIRA issue tracker. An account is also required to *comment on*, *vote on*, or *watch* issues. (If you only want to *search for* issues, you do not need an account.)

Once you are on the [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA) site, you have several options for viewing issues. 

* [Summary](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel) includes a graph and stream of recent activity. 
* [Issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:issues-panel) provides statistics and a list of unresolved issues by component.
* [Components](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:components-panel) allows you to quickly see unresolved and recently updated issues for a given component.

Use the `create` button at the top of the screen to add a new issue.
