# Web chat for Apache Taverna

Some of the Apache Taverna developers and users hang out on the Gitter
web chat [apache/taverna](https://gitter.im/apache/taverna) for more
informal communications.

Feel free to join us!

Note that the chat service is provided by a third-party and that
joining the chat will require either a GitHub or Twitter account.

## Decisions happen on the mailing lists

> If it didn't happen on the [mailing list](/community/lists), it didn't happen.

IRC and web chat channels can be great for informal enquiries like
("Where do I find `ClassB.java`"), code pastes and
and experimentation.

However by their synchronous nature chat rooms can
fail to include the wider community who might not share your
time zone, have the same day/night or work/life balance.

In addition some decisions are better taken in a paced conversation;
there's usually no rush. Email threads also make it easier to keep
issues separate, and findable later in the
[list archive](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@taverna.apache.org).

For all project decisions and information we therefore always
use the Taverna [mailing list](/community/lists).

It's OK if you get a good idea on the chat; just send an email
afterwards to the list. To be inclusive,
don't use a form like
_"We decided that Foo could be replaced with Bar"_,
but rather use a neutral form like
_"One idea is to replace Foo with Bar"_.

## IRC channel

The Taverna community previously used the
IRC chat channel [#taverna](irc://irc.freenode.net/%23taverna)
on [irc.freenode.net](http://freenode.net/).

[Gitter provides an IRC bridge](https://irc.gitter.im/)
which should work with most IRC clients to access
the apahce/taverna Gitter room.
