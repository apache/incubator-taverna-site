>A *service set* is a collection of services that have something in common,
   for example a compatible functionality or suitability for a domain.

## Adding service sets
You can add a set of services to the Service Panel by right-clicking on *Available Services*.
The service set can either be **specified in a file**, or **downloaded from a URL** on the Web that
   points to the service description file.
You have the choice to replace your current set of services, or to add to your set of services.

Note that the service templates and local services are not removed when you replace your service
   set.

## Saving service sets
You can save the set of services in the
   [Service Panel](/documentation/glossary#service_panel) of the Workbench by right-clicking on
   *Available Services* in the Service Panel.

## Available service sets
