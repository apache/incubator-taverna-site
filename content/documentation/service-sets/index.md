>A *service set* is a collection of services that have something in common,
   for example a compatible functionality or suitability for a domain.

## Adding service sets
You can add a set of services to the Workbench [Service Panel](/documentation/glossary#service_panel) 
by right-clicking on *Available Services*.
The service set can either be **specified in a file**, or **downloaded from a URL** on the Web that
   points to the service description file.
You have the choice to **replace** your current set of services, or **add** to your set of services.

Note that the service templates and local services are not removed when you replace your service
   set.

## Saving service sets
You can save the set of services in the Service Panel of the Workbench 
    by right-clicking on
   *Available Services* in the Service Panel.

## Available service sets
Currently available service sets include:
