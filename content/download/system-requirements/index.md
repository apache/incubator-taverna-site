Taverna is transitioning to the Apache Incubator.
Currently there is no Apache-approved distribution.
</div>

## Operating system

Taverna [Workbench](/download/workbench) and [Command Line](/download/commandline)
  are available either in platform-specific or platform-neutral distributions.
We generally **recommend** the platform-specific distributions as they include any required
   third-party software.

**Platform-specific** distributions are available for <small>(and tested on)</small>:

 - Windows 64-bit (.exe installer) <small>(7, 8, 8.1)</small>
 - Windows 32-bit (.exe installer) <small>(7)</small>
 - Mac OS X 64-bit (.dmg disk image) <small>(10.8, 10.9)</small>
 - Linux 64-bit Debian-based (.deb package) <small>(Ubuntu 12.04.4, Bio-Linux 7)</small>
 - Linux 64-bit Redhat-based (.rpm package) <small>(Fedora 20)</small>

**Platform-neutral** distributions are available as:

 - Zip file

The platform-neutral distribution has [additional system requirements](#standalone).

### Linux: libgnome

If you want to use the
   [Interaction service](http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/wiki/display/taverna/Interaction+service)
   from Taverna, for some versions of Linux it may be necessary to install the **libgnome-2.0**
   package or equivalent.
This library allows Taverna to open pages in your preferred Web browser and
   connect to the interactive service being called from the workflow.

## Memory

It is a good idea for your machine to have **at least 2GB of RAM.**
Taverna will run with less memory than that, but its performance may be affected.

The Taverna Workbench installations for 64-bit operating systems will use by default up to
1 GB of working memory, plus up to 400 MB used by the Java runtime.
Installations for 32-bit operating systems and platform-independent installations will
use up to 700 MB of working memory, plus up to 200 MB used by Java runtime.

### Reduce memory usage
 If Taverna runs out of memory while running a workflow with
 large data or large amounts of data, you can set Taverna to store data
 in a database by going to **Preferences -> Data and Provenance** and
 removing the tick for **“In-memory storage.”**
 Using a database will slightly reduce execution speed, but should consume less memory.
 Also remember to remove any old runs you are no longer interested in.
 
 [User guide: Data and provenance preferences](http://www.mygrid.org.uk/dev/wiki/display/taverna/Data+and+provenance+preferences)
 has more details on the data settings in Taverna.

### Increase available memory
If you need to increase the available memory, for **Windows and Linux**, edit the
  *taverna.vmoptions* (and *executeworkflow.vmoptions*) file inside Taverna's installation
  directory (which might require administrator privileges).
You can then replace *-Xmx700m* or *-Xmx1g* with (for example) *-Xmx1500m* to use 1.5 GB.

For **OS X**, you would need to modify the *Info.plist* file and change the same
   parameter under JavaVM using the *Property List Editor*.
   (To modify *Info.plist*, right-click on Taverna application in Finder and select *Show Package Content*.
   Then, open the application bundle to find *Contents/Info.plist*) 

For **platform-neutral** Taverna installations not using *.vmoptions*, you may instead have to
   modify the *taverna.sh/taverna.bat* (Windows) and *executeworkflow.bat/executeworkflow.sh* files.

[User guide: Memory allocation](http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/wiki/display/taverna/Memory+allocation)
   has more details on configuring memory allocation.

## Taverna Standalone requirements

Java and Graphviz are included in the platform-specific downloads but not in the zip downloads.

### Java

If you download a platform-neutral Taverna installation, you will need to install Java 7 or
   higher.

For Oracle's Java 7, you will also need to install the
   [Java Cryptography Extension](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html)
   separately.

For [OpenJDK 7](http://openjdk.java.net/), the Java Cryptography Extension is already included.
   On Linux, *apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk*, or equivalent, is usually sufficient.

> Taverna 2.5 has not been tested with Java 8.

>On newer versions of **Mac OS X**, Taverna Workbench might need the
   [XQuarts](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/) shared X11 libraries to be installed.

### GraphViz

If you download the platform-neutral Taverna Workbench installation,
   it includes binaries of the Graphviz tool,
   which is used for **generating workflow diagrams** in Taverna.
Binaries are included in the *bin* folder for OS X, Linux x86/x64, and Windows.

In most cases Taverna should be able to pick up the location of the Graphviz binary *dot*
   from the download after you have installed it.
If this is not the case, see
   [User guide: Workbench preferences](http://www.mygrid.org.uk/dev/wiki/display/taverna/Workbench+preferences)
   on how to configure the location of *dot* executable in Taverna Workbench.
