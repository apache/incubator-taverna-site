**Apache Taverna Common Activities** (incubating) provides the plugins for
invoking common activity types from [Taverna Engine](/download/engine),
including support for [REST]() and
[WSDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language)
web services, [Beanshell](https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell/) scripts,
command line tools and user interaction.

## Maven artifacts

Apache Taverna Common Activities are available from
[Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/taverna/common-activities/),
mirrored from
[ASF's Maven repository](https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/taverna/common-activities/).
For the convenience of IDE users, the Maven artifacts include `-javadoc.jar` and
`-sources.jar`; however, you might prefer the
online [API javadoc](/javadoc/taverna-common-activities/)
and the [source code releases](#source-code) (see below).


To use Taverna Common Activities with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), add
one or more of these to your `pom.xml`:

    <dependencies>

        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

The above `<version>` might not be up-to-date.
See the [source code releases](#source-code) below to find the latest version.

In addition, `taverna-wsdl-generic` can be used as an independent library for
[parsing WSDL definitions](/javadoc/taverna-common-activities/org/apache/taverna/wsdl/parser/package-summary.html)
and [invoking WSDL-described SOAP services](/javadoc/taverna-common-activities/org/apache/taverna/wsdl/soap/package-summary.html).


### Spring services

The activities are all OSGi services, registering with
[Taverna Engine](/download/engine)'s
[ActivityService](/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/capability/api/ActivityService.html), which
should be discoverable as a [Spring](https://spring.io/) service,
e.g. by adding the following code to
your `META-INF/spring/update-context-osgi.xml`:

    <beans:beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    	xmlns:beans="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    	xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                                     http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
                                     http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi
                                     http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi.xsd">
        <reference id="activityService" interface="org.apache.taverna.platform.capability.api.ActivityService" />
    </beans:beans>
