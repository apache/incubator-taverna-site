Taverna has transitioned to the Apache Incubator.
Currently there is no Apache version of the Taverna Command Line.
The first Apache version of the workbench is unlikely to include all the features of Taverna 2.5.
If there are particular features you feel should be prioritized please
<a class="alert-link" href="/community/lists">contact us</a>.
</div>


Taverna [Command Line Tool](/documentation/command-line) enables you to run workflows from a
  command prompt.

Taverna Command Line Tool is basically the Taverna Workbench stripped of its GUI so you can run
   workflows from a command prompt headlessly (i.e. without the graphical environment).

### Download Formats
