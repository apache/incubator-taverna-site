Taverna is transitioning to the Apache Incubator. 
Currently there is no Apache version of the Command Line.
This page is a template for the download page once an Apache version is available. 
</div>

The first Apache version of the command line is unlikely to include all the features of 
  Taverna 2.5.
If there are particular features you feel should be prioritized please [contact us](/community).

Taverna [Command Line Tool](/documentation/command-line) enables you to run workflows from a 
  command prompt.

Taverna Command Line Tool is basically the Taverna Workbench stripped of its GUI so you can run 
   workflows from a command prompt headlessly (i.e. without the graphical environment).

##Adding plugins

Taverna can be extended with various [Plugins](/documentation/plugins).
At this point it is undecided which plugins will be upgraded to Taverna 3.
If you are interested in the upgrade of any plugin to Taverna 3 please [contact us](/community) 

Similarly it has not yet been decided which plugins will be pre-populated into a commandline 
   download, and if so how this will be done.  

If you are interested in domain specific versions of Taverna as done in 
   [non-Apache Taverna 2.5](http://www.taverna.org.uk/download/command-line-tool/2-5/) please
