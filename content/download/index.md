##Which Taverna to download?
There are several Taverna tools you can download:

 - [Taverna Language](/download/language) gives programmatic access to
     inspecting, modifying and converting
     [SCUFL2](/documentation/scufl2/) workflow definitions and
     [Research Object Bundles](https://w3id.org/bundle).
 - [Taverna Workbench](/download/workbench) enables you to graphically create, edit and
     run workflows on your computer.
     Taverna 2.5 (non-Apache) Workbench is the latest series of the Workbench;
     it is highly recommended that you use this version if you are new to Taverna,
     or migrate to this version if you have used an earlier Taverna Workbench before.
 - [Taverna Command Line Tool](/download/command-line-tool) (not yet Apache) enables you to run
     workflows from a command prompt.
     This enables automated execution of workflows, e.g. on a Linux server.
 - [Taverna Server](/download/server) is the remote workflow execution service that enables you
      to set up a dedicated server for executing workflows remotely.
 - [Taverna Plugins](/documentation/plugins). The design of Taverna is modular in nature so that
      various plugins can be added in order to increase its functionality.

##Associated tools
There are also a number of associated tools available to use with (non-Apache) Taverna 2.

> **Note**: There are currently no known plans to bring out Apache Taverna
> versions of these tools. If you are interested in migrating these too
> to Apache Taverna, please [contact us](/community).

 - [Taverna 2-Galaxy](http://www.taverna.org.uk/download/taverna-galaxy/) is a tool for automatic generation and exposure of
   Taverna workflows as [Galaxy](http://galaxy.psu.edu/) tools.
   Galaxy is an open, Web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research.
 - [DataViewer Tool](http://www.taverna.org.uk/download/associated-tools/dataviewer-tool/)
