## Which Taverna to download?

Many, but not all, of the original Taverna tools have been migrated to Apache Taverna. 
(Taverna was started by the [myGrid project](http://www.mygrid.org.uk/) and in 2014 entered incubation 
at the [Apache Software Foundation](http://incubator.apache.org/).) 

Links to Pre-Apache versions are provided for tools that have yet to be migrated. See below for links to complete
<a href="#pre-Apache">earlier Taverna releases</a> as well as a list of Taverna 2.x tools that are 
<a href="#no-migration">not planned for migration</a>.


### Tools
There are several Taverna tools you can download:

- [Apache Taverna Command-line Tool](/download/commandline) enables you to run
  workflows from a command prompt.
  This enables scripted execution of workflows, e.g. on a Linux server.

- Pre-Apache Taverna (2.x)
    - [Taverna Workbench](/download/workbench) enables you to graphically create, edit and
   run workflows on your computer.
   Taverna 2.5 Workbench (non-Apache) is the latest series of the Workbench;
   it is highly recommended that you use this version if you are new to Taverna.

    - [Taverna Server](/download/server) is the remote workflow execution service that enables you
  to set up a dedicated server for executing workflows remotely.

    - [Taverna Plugins](/documentation/plugins) - because the design of Taverna is modular,
 various plugins can be added to increase its functionality.

### Taverna libraries

The Taverna Command-line, Workbench, and Server share several Java libraries
for constructing and executing workflows. These libraries can be downloaded
separately for development usage:

- [Apache Taverna Language](/download/language) gives programmatic access to
 inspecting, modifying and converting Taverna's
 [SCUFL2](/documentation/scufl2/) workflow definitions and
 [Research Object Bundles](https://w3id.org/bundle).

- [Apache Taverna OSGi](/download/osgi) is a generic plugin system for Java-based
 console/desktop applications using OSGi, including an online update mechanism.

- [Apache Taverna Engine](/download/engine) is the API for the _workflow engine_
  that executes workflows defined with _Taverna Language_.

- [Apache Taverna Common Activities](/download/common-activities) are plugins
  for the _Taverna Engine_ that provide implementations to invoke local and
  remote tools and web services.


## Source code

You might be interested in the [source code](/download/code) of Apache Taverna, or
[earlier non-Apache releases](pre-apache). Unreleased tools that are under development
include the [Apache Taverna Databundle Viewer](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-databundle-viewer) web app
and the Android app: [Apache Taverna Mobile](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-mobile).

## Pre-Apache tools
There are a number of third-party tools available to use with Taverna 2.

> **Note**: There are currently **no plans to release Apache Taverna 3
> versions** of these tools. If you are interested in migrating any of these tools
> to Apache Taverna, please [contact us](/community).

 - [Taverna 2-Galaxy](http://www.taverna.org.uk/download/taverna-galaxy/) is a tool for automatic generation and exposure of
   Taverna workflows as [Galaxy](http://galaxy.psu.edu/) tools.
