Taverna is transitioning to the Apache Incubator. 
Currently there is no Apache version of the Workbench.
This page is a template for the download page, once an Apache version is available. 
</div>

The first Apache version of the workbench is unlikely to include all the features of Taverna 2.5.
If there are particular features you feel should be prioritized please [contact us](/community).

##Adding plugins

Taverna can be extended with various [Plugins](/documentation/plugins).

Similarly, it has not yet been decided which plugins will be pre-populated into a workbench 
   download, and if so how this will be done.
