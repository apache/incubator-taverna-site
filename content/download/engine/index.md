**Apache Taverna Engine** (incubating) is the workflow engine of
Apache Taverna.

The engine executes a Taverna workflow, defined using
[Apache Taverna Language](/download/language/).

Note that the engine also needs the
[activity implementations](/download/common-activities/)
that actually perform work (e.g., calling a REST service). To
run Taverna workflows, use the
[Apache Taverna Command Line](/download/command-line/)
or [Taverna Server](/download/server/).

All Taverna Engine modules are also valid [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org/) bundles,
providing OSGi [Spring services](#spring-services).


## Maven artifacts

Apache Taverna Engine is available from
[Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/taverna/engine/),
mirrored from
[ASF's Maven repository](https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/taverna/engine/).
For the convenience of IDE users, the Maven artifacts include `-javadoc.jar` and
`-sources.jar`; however, you might prefer the
online [API javadoc](/javadoc/taverna-engine/)
and the [source code releases](#source-code) (see below).


To use Taverna Engine APIs with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), add
one or more of these to your `pom.xml`:

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.taverna.engine</groupId>
            <artifactId>taverna-run-api</artifactId>
            <version>3.1.0-incubating</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.taverna.engine</groupId>
            <artifactId>taverna-execution-api</artifactId>
            <version>3.1.0-incubating</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.taverna.engine</groupId>
            <artifactId>taverna-credential-manager-api</artifactId>
            <version>3.1.0-incubating</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.taverna.engine</groupId>
            <artifactId>taverna-capability-api</artifactId>
            <version>3.1.0-incubating</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.taverna.engine</groupId>
            <artifactId>taverna-report-api</artifactId>
            <version>3.1.0-incubating</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.taverna.engine</groupId>
            <artifactId>taverna-workflowmodel-api</artifactId>
            <version>3.1.0-incubating</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

The `<version>` above might not be up-to-date.
See the [source code releases](#source-code) below to find the latest version.

To use the OSGi implementations of these services, replace `-api` with `-impl` above.
Note that you would need either to manually wire the services together or use
[Spring services](#spring-services) (see below).



## Usage

See the complete
[list of Taverna Engine modules](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-engine/#modules),
a description of [which modules do what](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-engine/#which-module-does-what),
and the [Javadoc for Taverna Engine](/javadoc/taverna-engine/).

### Spring services

The OSGi services should be
discoverable as [Spring services](https://spring.io/),
e.g. by adding to
your `META-INF/spring/update-context-osgi.xml`:

    <beans:beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:beans="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
      xsi:schemaLocation="
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi.xsd">

      <reference id="executionService" interface="org.apache.taverna.platform.execution.api.ExecutionService"/>
      <reference id="runService" interface="org.apache.taverna.platform.run.api.RunService"/>
      <reference id="credentialManager" interface="org.apache.taverna.security.credentialmanager.CredentialManager" />
      <reference id="databaseConfiguration" interface="org.apache.taverna.configuration.database.DatabaseConfiguration" />
      <reference id="databaseManager" interface="org.apache.taverna.configuration.database.DatabaseManager" />

    </beans:beans>

After downloading the files,
[verify the PGP signatures](http://www.apache.org/info/verification.html)
using the Apache Taverna [KEYS](https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/taverna/KEYS)
file.

### Source code repositories

For the latest developments you may also be interested in the corresponding
[source code](/download/code/) repositories:

* [incubator-taverna-engine](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-engine)

Each release has a corresponding tag, e.g. `3.1.0-incubating`.

### Archived releases

For all archived Apache Taverna releases, see
[archive.apache.org](https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/taverna/).

The source code for Taverna Engine before migrating to Apache
(Taverna 2.5 and earlier) is available
as a series of `old/` tags in the git repository, e.g.
[core-1.5](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-engine/tree/old/core-1.5),
note that the older code was licensed as LGPL 2.1.

Binaries for older releases are also available in the
[myGrid repository](/download/maven/#pre-apache-releases-and-snapshots),
e.g. as [net.sf.taverna.t2.core](http://www.mygrid.org.uk/maven/repository/net/sf/taverna/t2/core/)
and other groupIds. The myGrid repository is not affiliated with the
Apache Software Foundation and is provided for archival purposes only.
