Taverna is transitioning to the Apache Incubator. 
Currently there is no Apache version of Taverna Server. 
This page is a template for the download page once an Apache version is available. 
</div>

This version of the Server is based on Taverna 2.5 and is called **Taverna Server 2.5.4**. 
[Documentation](/documentation/server/) for the Server is available on-line.

##Installation

Download the **[Taverna Server 2.5.4 WAR](http://www.taverna.org.uk/download/server/2-5/)** and 
   follow the 
   [installation instructions](http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/wiki/display/taverna/Installation+Guide).

The software distributor Launchpad has an archive of 
   [earlier non-Apache releases of Taverna Server](https://launchpad.net/taverna-server/+series).

##System Requirements

####Operating system

The Server can currently be installed on Linux and Mac OS X.

####Java

You will need a Java 7 installation or newer. 
Either OpenJDK 7 or Oracle Java 7 are recommended.

> If using Oracle Java 7, you must install the 
>   **[Java Cryptography Extension extension for Java
>   1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html)**
>   and follow the included README on how to install the JCE to
>   *lib/security/* of your Java installation. 
>   This is *not* necessary for OpenJDK 7.

####WebApp container

You will need a suitable servlet container.

The Server has been developed using [Tomcat 6.0.26](http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi)
   as the servlet container, but other versions of Tomcat are known to work 
   (back to at least Tomcat 6.0.20, and up to Tomcat 7.0.53) and other containers may also 
   function correctly, as no Tomcat-specific APIs are used in the deployable code. 
   We welcome feedback on which containers work, as well as on how to configure them.

##Source Code

The source code to Apache Taverna Server is available from the Taverna project's 
   [space on Apache's Git Server](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=incubator-taverna-server.git). 
The 2.5.4 release was made automatically using Apache Maven from the 
   [2.5.4](https://github.com/taverna/taverna-server/releases/tag/2.5.4) git tag; 
   you may download the [exact source tree](http://www.taverna.org.uk/download/server/2-5/) 
   if you wish, but it is easier to fork and check out the code.

If you encounter any problems, please [contact us](/community).

##Client side stuff
                   
To complement the Taverna Server, 
   we have developed several client side libraries and applications. 
They access the Server's functionality and can help you build your client applications around 
   the Server and provide exemplars of how such applications can  be implemented.

###General

 - A [Ruby gem](https://github.com/myGrid/taverna2-gem) that enables you to interact with 
     Taverna 2 workflows (.t2flow files). 
   You can generate a t2flow model using the gem, and then use it to retrieve various 
      information about the workflow by invoking different methods and attributes. You can also draw a workflow diagram using the gem.</li>
 - A [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/taverna-baclava) for handling Baclava files.
