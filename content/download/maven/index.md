Taverna is transitioning to the Apache Incubator.
Currently there is no Apache release of any Taverna products.
This page is a template for the download page once an Apache version is available.
</div>

## Apache releases

Apache Taverna releases are distributed in
[Apache's Maven repository](https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/taverna/language/)
which is also mirrored to Maven's default
[Maven Central](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/taverna/).

Therefore, normally no `<repository>` should be needed to use
released Apache Taverna Maven artifacts, however in some situations you may
need to specify:

    <repository>
        <id>central</id>
        <name>Central Repository</name>
        <url>https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </snapshots>      
    </repository>

See the individual [download pages](/download) for details of
Maven `<dependencies>`.

### Snapshots

[Snapshot builds](/download/code/#snapshot-builds) are available for developers
who want to take part in the Apache Taverna
[developer community](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/community/).

    <repository>
        <id>apache.snapshots</id>
        <name>Apache Snapshot Repository</name>
        <url>https://repository.apache.org/snapshots</url>
        <releases>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </releases>
    </repository>

Note that the snapshot builds are _not_ official releases and should be
considered unstable.

It is recommended to subscribe to the
[dev@taverna mailing list](/community/lists#devtaverna)
before using the `-SNAPSHOT` builds.

## Pre-Apache releases and snapshots

The pre-Apache Taverna artifacts are available as a Maven download from
  <http://repository.mygrid.org.uk/artifactory/mygrid-all/>,
hosted by the [eScience Lab, University of Manchester](http://www.esciencelab.org.uk/)

> Note that these repositories are _not_ affiliated with Apache Software Foundation
and is maintained for archival purposes only.

You may need to use the Maven repository if developing plugins for Taverna 2.x:

#### Release repository

    <repository>
        <id>mygrid-repository</id>
        <name>myGrid Repository</name>
        <url>http://www.mygrid.org.uk/maven/repository</url>
        <releases />
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>

#### Snapshot repository

    <repository>
        <id>mygrid-snapshot-repository</id>
        <name>myGrid Snapshot Repository</name>
        <url>http://www.mygrid.org.uk/maven/snapshot-repository</url>
        <releases>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </releases>
        <snapshots />
    </repository>
