Taverna is used by various projects for the creation of chemistry workflows.  These include:

 - [Chemistry Development Kit][1] (CDK) - integration of a chemistry-specific toolkit with Taverna
 - [Chemical Informatics and Cyberinfrastructure Collaboratory][2] (CICC) -use of Taverna for workflow creation

##Chemistry Development Kit##
                    
The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) [project][3] have developed a 
   [plugin](/documentation/plugins#cdk)
   to allow their tools to be used within Taverna workflows.</p>

There is a myExperiment [group][5]</a> for workflows using the CDK-Taverna plugin.</p>

This work has been described in the [poster][6]
    *Creating chemo- &amp; bioinformatics workflows, further developments within the CDK-Taverna Project* 
    by Kuhn et al.

The latest posts from the  CDK Taverna [Web site][7] are:

 - [CDK-Taverna 2.0 Final version released][8]
 - [CDK-Taverna 2.0 released][9] 
 - [CDK-Taverna installation instructions][10]
 - [CDK-Taverna Version 0.5.1.1 released][11]

 - [Atom typing on natural products with the cdk][13]
 - [myExperiment.org plug-in for Taverna][14]

##Chemical Informatics and Cyberinfrastructure Collaboratory##

Within the Chemical Informatics and Cyberinfrastructure Collaboratory (CICC) project

> uses modern Grid technology to allow convenient integration of
> distributed chemistry tools, simulations,  documents and databases
> among themselves and with similar biological resources.

The members of the CICC are developing Taverna workflows

> which encapsulate important processes in chemoinformatics and drug
> design,     use diverse kinds of information together in novel ways,  
> and which are of demonstrated scientific merit.
