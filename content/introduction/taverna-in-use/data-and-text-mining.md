Taverna is used for the automation of data and text mining by various projects and researchers.  
These include:

 - [e-Lico][1] - building a virtual e-science laboratory for interdisciplinary collaborative research in data mining 
      and data-intensive sciences
 - [Adaptive Information Disclosure (AID) workflows][2] - workflows to extract knowledge and data to 
      associate proteins and diseases
 - [Course generator][3]</a> - workflow to create a course based upon user requirements
 - [REFINE][4] - representing evidence for interacting network elements
 - [Open software development workflows][5] - modelling the development of open software projects
 - [TaWeka][6] - mining databases for subsequent machine learning

##AID##
                    

Taverna is used by researchers at [NBIC][7] as an enactment platform for [BioAID][8] workflows from 
   the AIDA (Adaptive Information Disclosure Application) toolkit developed by [VL-e][9] 
   that offers services for knowledge extraction, text mining and knowledge management.

There is a myExperiment [group][10] for AID workflows.

###Publications###
The [presentation][11] *My BioAID: personalised text mining with Web services from the AIDA toolbox* 
   by Marco Roos describes the use of the AIDA toolkit and Taverna.

##Open software development workflows##

Taverna has been used to model the research community developing open source software together with 
   the software itself. 
This work, done by the Free/Libre Open Source Software Research community is described on the [Web site][12], 
   in particular their [publications][13].

There is a myExperiment [group][14] for researchers studying open source software development.  
The myExperiment group share some of their Taverna [workflows][15].
