Taverna 3 is a re-engineering of the Taverna codebase to use OSGi.

 - New plugin-system
 - Usability improvements
 - Easily customisable service sets
 - More complete service type support

###Taverna 3 Platform updated beta###

 - Available as an [OGSi][3] bundle or Jar (for non-OGSi environments for easy embedding)
 - Using [SCUFL2][4] workflow bundle format
 - API for running workflows

##Tavena 2##
This site only covers the Apache Taverna product. 
As Taverna 2 is not an Apache product so its roadmap can be found on the previous [taverna website][5].
