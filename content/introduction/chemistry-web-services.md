This document describes a set of chemistry services provided by [ChemSpider][1], [ChEBI][2] and [PubChem][3]
  that can be used for the construction of chemistry workflows from the Taverna Workbench.

Example workflows contained in the document show how some of the operations from the services in the set can
  be invoked.

## ChemSpider

[ChemSpider][5] is a chemistry search engine that has been built with the intention of aggregating and indexing
   chemical structures and  their associated information into a single searchable repository and making it
   freely available to everybody.

ChemSpider provides several Web services, and these are listed below together with their WSDL locations.

### InChi Web service
WSDL: [http://www.chemspider.com/InChI.asmx?WSDL][6]

<img src="/img/biocatalogue-smallcog.png" alt="BioCatalogue icon" width="16" height="16" />
In BioCatalogue: [http://www.biocatalogue.org/services/2164][7]

The InChI Web service provides operations to manipulate InChI Strings and InChIKeys,
   including the conversion to and from the  MOL file format, validity checking of InChI identifiers,
   and searching  ChemSpider using InChI inputs.

Some of the Web service&#8217;s operations listed below require a &#8220;security  token&#8221;.
A security token can be obtained by completing the registration process for ChemSpider at
[http://www.chemspider.com/Register.aspx][8].

The following operations are contained within the InChI Web service:

 - **CSIDToMol**   
   Converts a ChemSpider identifier to a MOL file. A security token is required to get access to this
   service.   
   [Example workflow][9]
