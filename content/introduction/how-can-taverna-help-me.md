If you need to perform multi-step or repetitive analysis that involves invoking several services, 
   or if you find yourself copying and pasting results between different Web pages or services, 
   and would like to automate this process, then Taverna could be suitable for you.

Taverna allows you to define how your data flows between the services, 
   without having to worry how you are going to invoke these services. 
It will automate and pipeline processing of your data.

Taverna can help you convert data from one format to another in cases when the services you are using are not 100% compatible 
   and shield you from services’ (non-)interoperability horror.

Taverna allows for rapid incorporation of  new  service s without  coding.  It is not  restricted  to  predetermined  services; it provides access  to  local  and  remote  resources  and  analysis  tools – 3500+ services available on start up.

Taverna will provide you with trackable results of your experiments using the OPM (Open Provenance Model) standard. Workflow provenance gives a detailed trace of workflow execution: which services were executed, when, which inputs were used and what outputs were produced.

Taverna lets you do collaborative science – share your workflows on myExperiment through the Taverna Workbench and search and download workflows from your fellow scientists.
